      <p>I am a proud father of three beautiful children. They truly fill my life with joy! I have a two sons and a daughter who all have personalities to keep us entertained for days.</p>
      <p>I enjoy coding and have been working at it every moment of my free time. I am hoping to learn as many languages and programs as my brain will allow so that I can be full of knowledge in this field.</p>
      <p>Traveling is a hobby of mine as me and my family love to go to new countries and experience new cultures with all the food, family and music each place offers. We hope Full Stack web development will allow us to travel to more places and learn from all lands!</p>
